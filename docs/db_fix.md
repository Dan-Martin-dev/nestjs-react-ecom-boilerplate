Collecting workspace informationBased on the error message, I can see that you're having an issue with the database connection in your NestJS-React e-commerce boilerplate. The specific error is:

```
Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL.
```

This means Prisma is trying to connect to your database, but can't find the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Let's fix this:

## Solution

1. First, ensure your `.env.dev` file contains the correct `DATABASE_URL` variable. The Makefile shows you're using the `dev` command which uses the Docker Compose setup with the `.env.dev` file.

2. Run the database initialization script to set up your database properly:

```bash
make db-init
```

This script will:
- Start your database container
- Generate the Prisma client
- Create and apply initial migrations

3. After database initialization, check if connections are properly set up:

```bash
make check-connections
```

If there are still issues, you'll need to make sure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correctly defined in your `.env.dev` file. Based on your project structure, it should look something like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/ecommerce_db
```

Make sure to replace the values with your actual database credentials.

4. Once you've verified the environment variables, regenerate the Prisma client:

```bash
make db-generate
```

5. Then restart the API:

```bash
make rebuild-restart-api
```

If you're running in development mode with the `dev` command from your Makefile, you can simply run:

```bash
make dev
```

This will start all services with the correct environment variables loaded.
